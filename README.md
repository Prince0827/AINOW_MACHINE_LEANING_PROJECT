## Project Title

**Insurance Claims Prediction for Buildings**

### Project Overview

Insurance companies operate in a **risk-driven environment,** where profitability depends on accurately assessing and managing the likelihood of claims.Incorrect assessment can lead to: 

**Underpricing high-risk building,** resulting in financial losses.
**Overpricing low-risk building**, causing customer dissatisfaction an churn.

Thus, this project aim to **build a predictive model that determine whether a building will experience at least one insurance claim within the specified insured period**, or simply put** to estimate the probability of of a claim occurrence** based on the features provided (independent variable) in the dataset.
 - Building characteristics (e.g, painted, fenced, garden etc)
 - Location attributes (e.g, urban or not urban)
 - Other organizational  and structural condition available **beforeany claim occurs**

Traget variable represent whether **at least one insurance claim** was reported during the insurance period.
