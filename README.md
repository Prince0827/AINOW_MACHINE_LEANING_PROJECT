### Project Title

**Insurance Claims Prediction for Buildings**

### Objective

The objective of this project is to **build a predictive algorithm (model) that determines whether a building will experience at least one insurance claim
within a specified insured period,** or to *simply put,**the model aims to estimate the probability of a claim occurrence** based on:

 - Building characteristics (e.g, painted, fenced, garden)
 - Location attributes (e.g, urban or rural settlement)
 - Other organizational and structural conditions available, before any claim occurs.

The target variable represents whether **at least one insurance claim** was reported during the insured period.
