## Project Title

**Insurance Claims Prediction for Buildings**

### Project Overview

Insurance companies operate in a **risk-driven environment,** where profitability depends on accurately assessing and managing the likelihood of claims.Incorrect assessment can lead to: 

**Underpricing high-risk building,** resulting in financial losses.
**Overpricing low-risk building**, causing customer dissatisfaction an churn.

Thus, this project aim to **build a predictive model that determine whether a building will experience at least one insurance claim within the specified insured period**, or simply put** to estimate the probability of of a claim occurrence** based on the features provided (independent variable) in the dataset.
 - Building characteristics (e.g, painted, fenced, garden etc)
 - Location attributes (e.g, urban or not urban)
 - Other organizational  and structural condition available **beforeany claim occurs**

Traget variable represent whether **at least one insurance claim** was reported during the insurance period.

 ### Data Source
 
 The data used for this **Machine Learning** project is provided by the consortium instructors and the admin (my assumption) at the **AI NOW BOOT CAMP** an offshoot programme of the **INCUBATOR HUB**.

 ### Tools Used
 
  - Microsoft Visual Studio code editor,
     - used for providing platform and extension that provide the  kernel base, python terminal,gitbash etc
  - Python Kernel/server
     - for importing Scikit-Learn, XGBoost,Numpy and Pandas Libraries etc.
  - Git bash/version control
     - this tool ensure safety, collaboration and tracking changes.
   
 ### Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

 After importing neccesary libraries in to the python environment the following task were perfom:
  - Data loading, description and inspection
  - Handling missing,duplicates and data conversion
  - Removing Outliers,determining level of correlation, Scaling and normalisation

### Explorative Data Analysis
